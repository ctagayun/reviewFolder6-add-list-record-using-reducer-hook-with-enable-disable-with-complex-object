  Task:
    Incorporate bootstrap 

  Setup: 
    npm install bootstrap
    Once the installation is complete, we can include it in our appâ€™s 
    entry file in main.jsx :
    --  Bootstrap CSS
    import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
    -- Bootstrap Bundle JS
    import "bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min";

    Now since we created the project with Vite, we can rely 
    on Vite's plugins to integrate ESLint properly. Run the 
    following command
       npm install vite-plugin-eslint --save-dev

    install uuid node package 
       npm install uuid

      ///React Advance State Reducer Hook
      // see: https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-state-usereducer-usestate-usecontext/
      
      //How to useReducer in React: https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-usereducer-hook/
      
      //useReducer is best to use if multiple states are dependent on each other.
      //For stories, boolean is Loading, and error are all related to data fetching. 
      //All three properties/state could be a part of one complex object (example data, isLoading, error)
      //managed by a reducer
      
      //Again the first thing to do when using React.useReducer hook
      //is to define a reducer FUNCTION outside of the component.
      //A reducer function always receives a state and an action. 
      //Based on these two arguments, returns a new state.
      
      //A reducer function always receives a state and an action (A). 
      //Based on these two arguments, a reducer always returns a new state:
      //  1. 'action' is always associated with a type (B) and payload (B)
      //  2. If the type matches a condition in the reducer (B), return a new state (C) 
      //    based on incoming state and action.
      
      
      //In the following example: 
      //The listReducer function covers "one type" and then returns the 
      //payload of the incoming action without using the current state to 
      //compute the new state. The new state is therefore simply the payload.
      
      //Define a reducer function. It always receives state and action
      //   1.'action' is always associated with a type. In this example
      //     there are 2 types: 'ADD_ITEM' and 'DELETE_ITEM' 
      //     each type returns appropriate action.payload.
      //
      //   2. If the type matches a condition  in this case 'ADD_ITEM' 
      //      and 'DELETE_ITEM' the reducer return a new state based on 
      //       incoming state and action.
      //   3. Based on these two arguments the reducer always returns 
      //     a new state
      
      
      const listReducer = (state, action) =>{
        switch (action.type) { //(A)
          //based on the action type implement the business logic
          case 'ADD_ITEM':

            //explicitly -- which didn't change
            //but in this case we are using JavaScript's spread operator to spread all 
            //key/value pairs from the state object into the new "state" object, 
            //while overriding the list property (the only property that was changed)
